# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This challenge is part of module 1 in the Data Science Bootcamp.
The purpose of this project is to review information provided by previous kickstart campaigns, and to 
determine what insights can be gleamed from a review of the data.  This study involved the use of MS Excel
and targetted data provided from an international source that included campaign types, outcomes, goals, and countries.
By conducting the analysis in Excel, students (like me) in this program are better able to use Excel for detailed data analysis.

### Purpose
In this challenge, we were tasked with identifying conclusions about kickstarter campaigns related to Launch Dates and Goals.
Louise wants to know how different campaigns performed, and what additional information could be deduced based on the data.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the figure below, Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch, there were always more successful outcomes than failures.  
This means that using KickStarter for theater projects will lead to net positive revenue.  However, failures were
observed in each month.  So the question arises, which months would be better suited for a launch?  
Again, review of the chart shows that the highest successful outcomes were observed in the month of May, tapering off till September.  
Therefore, theater campaigns should target launches in the April/May timeframe for the greatest likelihood of sucess.

The month of December had an equivalent number of both successful and failed outcomes, and the lowest number of successful outcomes.
This means that a campaign launched in December would likely be less succesful than a launch in the spring/summer season.  Therefore, a 
December campaign should be avoided.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Based on the figure below, Outcomes_vs_Goals, campaigns that had a goal less than $15000 had success rate that was higher than their failure rate.  
Similarly, campaign goals that were between $35000 to $45000 also had a higher success rate.  This means that campaign goals should be under $15000, or between $35000 and $45000 for the greatest likelihood of success.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One of the challenges I had difficulty with was setting up my system at home so that I could look at all the data properly, while still reading the instructions
and watching the videos.  I had to purchase two new monitors to ensure that I had the right hardware set-up for this project.

I also didn't enjoy coding in github directly, or using notepad.  Neither of them have spell check, I believe, and it was as though I needed to learn an entirely
new language.  So, during office hours with Jesse, he guided me to Visual Studios which I will learn this week and start using.  (I'm still not sure about the 
spell check on VS but will look into that).


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

That May, June, and July were the best months to launch a campaign based on outcome.
And that December was the worst month to launch a campaign based on outcome.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

That a campaign goal of under $15000, or between $35000 and $45000 would be more succesful.


- What are some limitations of this dataset?

A key metric missing from this data set is access to the interner.  How well do the countries, or regions where the kickstarter campaign was launched, have access to internet
and mobile funding.  More importantly, how established is the kickstarter platform as a brand in those countries.  Understanding the market awareness or impact of the kickstarer website in different regions would be a useful tool in validating the dataset and subsequent conclusions.


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?a 

If there was more time, there would be plenty of analysis to be done based on interantional trends.  Higher success rates occur in the summer months in the northern 
hemisphere, but was a similar pattern observed for countries in the southern hemisphere.  Similarly, we should look at the different years for possible political or
economic forces that affected people's ability to contribute to the campaign.
